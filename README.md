## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prashantk1220/finance-ai-agent.git
   cd finance-ai-agent
   ```
   
2. Use the Makefile commands to Install all the required libraries.
   Prerequistie: The system should have Python3.9 or above installed. 
    ```
   make install
   ```
  

## Usage

Prerequisite: The database should be working and accepting connections on the port defined in env file.
```
make run
```

Launch the UI using another terminal with:
```
make ui
```

### Backend 
After running `make run`, the FastAPI backend is available at:
 * **Swagger UI**: http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs 
 
### UI 
After running `make ui`, the Gradio UI will be available at:
 * **Gradio UI**: http://127.0.0.1:7860‚Äù

Use the UI for your queries.

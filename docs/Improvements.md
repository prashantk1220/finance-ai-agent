## Scope Issue

1. In the limited time scope I could not add more tools, which could basically plot the graph or chats on Matplotlib
from the Pandas dataframe. The Tools and prompt for the Agent can be improved, given some additional time. 

2. Poetry or other dependency manager tools can be used for production use.
3. Then of course containerisation of the application.

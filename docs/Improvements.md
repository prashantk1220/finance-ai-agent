## Scope Issue

1. Facing the attached issue  while installing MongoDB, comes out that it's related to old MacOS. 
Although I tried updating my MacOS twice but it fails in between also due to low storage space. Even other installation process had some time.
This had taken most of my time as well, along with going through the latest LangChain documents and various agent configuration.

2. In the limited time scope I could not add more tools, which could basically plot the graph or chats on Matplotlib
from the Pandas dataframe. The Tools and prompt for the Agent can be improved, given some additional time. 

3. Poetry or other dependency manager tools can be used for production use.
4. Then of course containerisation of the application.
